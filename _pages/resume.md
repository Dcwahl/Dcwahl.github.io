Technical Experience
--------------------

### Data Science/ML Projects:

#### EMNIST Classification
Built variety of models to solve problem of hadnwritten digit classification in the context of the 62 class EMNIST dataset. Approaches included:

* Applied **unsupervised learning** techniques (TSNE, PCA, MI) in order to drive simple classification models such as standard **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost** with a acceptable accuracy and runtime.
* **Convolutional Neural Network** with **Keras**

#### Twitter Data Pipeline
Implemented data pipeline to intake tweets via Twitter API and Tweepy, perform analysis in Python, and interface with **MongoDB**, with particular goal of permitting large scale data handling.

#### Twitter NLP; exploring political discourse
Applied variety of unsupervised learning techniques, including (though not limited to) **VADER** sentiment analysis, **CorEx** topic modeling, as well as **Scattertext** and **WordCloud** Python packages for visualization, in order to explore, compare, and contrast political discourse on Twitter.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
